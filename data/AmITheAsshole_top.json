I went anyway and she kept arguing about me taking the wrong side instead of defending her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for her but at the same time I think that she was being irrational and made this a competion despite knowing how our son and his wife felt about her behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 100, "id": "gid_1", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.", "end_date": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 19, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Silver", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png"}, {"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

For an assignment recently, we were each expected to do a presentation on a life event that was meaningful to us. \n\nThis girl presented on her church group mission trip to a \"impoverished\" area and how it showed her how people live with so little but are happy and how it's important to think of the needy and live in service of others.\n\nIt wasn't something I related to that much, I'm not religious and the kinda charity work I usually do is local and in my own communities. \n\nBut then halfway though the presentation, she showed a slide of herself and her group posing beside my hometown's welcome sign!! And it hit me, her trip was to my town. I couldn't help it, I started to laugh. It drew everyone's attention, and the harder I tried to stop laughing the harder I laughed. The teacher asked what was so funny that I had to interrupt the presentation... I think she'd meant it as a rhetorical question but I only realized that later and answered literally, saying.\n\n\"That's my hometown! It's a normal ass hometown, I thought she was talking about somewhere impoverished but that's just a nicer small town in Virginia!\" \n\nThe teacher asked me not to interrupt and we could talk after class, and the girl continued her presentation with stuff about how the whole town was so grateful. I was messaging my friends from high school on my laptop like \"has literally anyone heard of her or this church group?\" And nobody had. Some of my friends were joking about how mission trips are so bullshit and a way for rich people to go vacation and come home and call it \"serving the poor\" when honestly the \"poor\" probably don't want them there and might not even be poor. Like just call it a vacation. \n\nAt the end of the presentation she had time for questions, and I asked... Since she was talking about giving youth services to a town that was lacking... If she was aware of the many after school programs, community sports, big sister little sister programs, YMCA programs, informal community care groups, etc... That were already available. And what additional services her group had provided that were lacking. \n\nShe really didn't have an answer for it and stammered through an answer about traveling from another place to work with kids?\n\nI started feeling kinda mean, like what if this girl just went as a kid and was brainwashed by her church group into thinking that that's what poor people look like, maybe she was sheltered from knowing how most people live? And brainwashed into thinking she was doing good? Like I can see how a young person who wants to do good and is very sheltered could buy into that BS? \n\nAfter class the teacher told me she understood how I might be uncomfortable (???)

And just my luck that my mom's anniversary with her husband was on Sunday.\n\nI haven't had a good time here at all so all I do is stay in my room doing homework or go out with friends to avoid family activities cause it sucks seeing how lovey dovey she is with her husband and how they seem like the perfect family with their daughters. The morning before her anniversary day she came to my bed and tried to cuddle with me like before she left us but it made me angry like we can't go back in time and pretend it's how it was. So I just pretended to be asleep and stayed curled up and frozen till she left. I started crying cause of that and I felt angry and snarky and my mom majored in literature so I got her a copy of Anna Karenina for her anniversary. That book's about a lady who leaves her husband and son for her lover. I've never read it but I watched the movie with my girlfriend and I hated it.\n\nThe anniversary party was on Sunday. Everyone was having fun but me and then people gave their gifts. I gave mine and when my mom saw what it was she seemed shocked but just said thanks. The party ended like an hour after. But at night when she was in her room I heard her crying really loudly. So I kinda eavesdropped a little and heard her saying stuff about that book and me and her husband trying to calm her. The next day at breakfast she left for work early before I woke up and her husband straight up called me an asshole and other stuff for gifting them that.

But to everyone who keeps DMing me here&amp;#39;s some facts to read before you do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I gave my mom the book to try and get it across to her that I hate being at her house and being around her family and that it hurts me to be there because I sympathized with the son from the movie not because I want a train to run her over - I do not want that to happen to my mom&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I do not want my dad to get back together with my mom, he&amp;#39;s happy with his fiancee&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My dad has his reasons for not wanting me to go to therapy and is just being protective&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yes I stopped visiting my mom cause I hate her husband but she had custody of me on weekends or breaks she could&amp;#39;ve forced me to be with her but since being with him or making him be with us whenever I did go to her was more important she never tried anything beyond the bare minimum of going to big events.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 100, "id": "gid_1", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.", "end_date": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 18, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Silver", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png"}, {"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

We're Indian, her marriage was arranged. They have 3 beautiful kids. I love my niece and nephews more than anything\n\n I married my husband (26) two years ago and we have been trying for a baby for almost one year. My sister always said that it was because I brought shame to my parents for marrying outside our culture that I couldn't have a baby.  After many negative pregnancy tests, a few months ago, we finally had a positive pregnancy test. Unfortunately, when I was four months, I had a miscarriage. I was devastated. I couldn't believe what was going on. Two months after our tragedy, my family threw my sister a birthday party. There she and her husband announced they were pregnant. My heart did ache, but I was happy for them\n\nAs the evening went on, my sister kept making comments like, \"we weren't even trying for a baby\", \"It so funny how we get pregnant so easily\".

We were standing with cousins when my sister said \"We didn't even want more kids, I was almost contemplating having an abortion\" She said all that while looking at me. \n\nI am all for women having abortions, but having my sister use it as a weapon against me. Showing off how fertile she is, how she was contemplating having an abortion after they decided to keep the baby and announce it. That really hurt me. I was so upset and frustrated. My husband noticed the change in my emotions immediately. We said goodbye to my parents and let the party immediately.\n\n I got many texts from my sister and our cousins calling me jealous and an asshole for walking out on my sister's birthday party, and not being part of their pregnancy celebration.

I got woken up by him calling asking me to give him my credit card PIN number, I was confused I asked why and he said he went grocery shopping with my card and forgot to ask me to give him the PIN before he left, I got mad and felt quite violated, I told him I was sorry but I gave no permission for him to go out and shop using my card, he sounded confused and said he was just trying to buy us breakfast and it only cost $20. I said I was sorry but refused to give him the PIN number. He obviously sounded upset and asked why. I told him because he didn't consider getting my permission to take my card and use it. He said \"alright then, guess no breakfast for us\" then hung up. I called and called but no response. He returned and handed me the card back then, went on to complain about how he was just trying to buy us breakfast and that he wasn't intending on making a huge purchase. I said I understood but it's all about consent to me, He seemed pretty irritated and upset though he said it was fine, He left after this and hasn't returned my calls.\n\n\nHe then texted that he wasn't intending on stealing from me and that he thought that I wouldn't make such a fuss about it and that he DID get my permission when he called to ask for the PIN number but I feel like it's just me feeling like he violated my boundaries. He's been upset since then saying I ruined our time together by making a huge deal out if it and embarrassing him at the store by making him return the stuff he bought at the register.\n\n\nGosh!

When our country was still colonized by the British, he (my great grandfather) was taken in by some missionaries and became a teacher. As a teacher he was super instrumental to the community and partly funded the first black owned school there. He became headmaster and as thanks, the community chipped in to get him a pocket watch.

I had even made an effort of hinting how l wanted a watch for the whole year prior. \n\nAmong the presents l saw this small box and got excited thinking it was the watch. The watch came in this wooden casing with a velvet lining inside and it was about the same size as the box l saw. I made a deliberate choice to open that box last to make sure the night ended on a highlight. \n\nWhen it came time to opening the box, it was a watch but a digital one.

This came as a blow since I've always been closer to my dad than my brother was and my brother isn't even interested in the watch like l have been my whole life.

He hasn\u2019t had a real birthday party since he was 2 years old due to Covid, so this was the first one he\u2019d actually remember. We wanted to make it special so we invited all our closest friends, family members and their kids.\n\nOne of my cousins, a single mom, has a very unruly 6 year-old. He is loud, disobedient, and a nightmare in public. When it came time to blow out the candles and cut the birthday cake, he came and stood directly next to my son. I anticipated what was going to happen next and asked my husband to stand behind this kid in case he tried to pull anything.\n\nAfter we sang, this kid kept trying to blow out the candles. My husband kept blocking him and pulling him back and we could tell the kid was getting frustrated. Eventually my son blew out the candles and the kid absolutely lost it. He threw a tantrum and slammed his entire arm into the cake, knocking it into the table. It was so awkward, everyone gasped and got quiet. My son looked up at us and I could tell he was about to start crying. In an effort to not cause a bigger scene, my husband picked him up and whispered to him that we had another special cake just for him (we didn\u2019t) and he seemed to calm down.\n\nMeanwhile, his cousin was still standing there screaming and crying, his arm covered in cake. His mom was nowhere to be seen. I walked him over to the sink and washed him off and quietly told him that he shouldn\u2019t have done that to the cake and that he should apologize to his cousin for what he did. He screamed \u201cNO!\u201d in my face and then ran away.\n\nMy husband ended up running out to buy a sheet cake that we cut and served to everyone. I spoke to my cousin after the party about what happened since she wasn\u2019t in the room, and she brushed it off saying \u201ckids will be kids\u201d. I completely disagree. I\u2019ve been to plenty of birthday parties where the other kids let the birthday boy/girl have their moment. I suggested she pay for the ruined cake and she looked at me like I was crazy.\n\nI told her how important it was to us that this birthday be special to my son since it would be the first one he remembered, and now all he would remember was that his cousin ruined his special moment. She got extremely defensive and refused to pay for anything. She then accused me of acting like \u201cthe perfect mom\u201d and began to list the ways in which I was in fact NOT perfect. It was a hurtful conversation and we haven\u2019t spoken since.\n\nI sent her the bill for the ruined cake and she has not paid us. I actually feel she should pay for both cakes since her kid is the reason we had to get a new one, but I didn\u2019t go that far. My husband thinks she\u2019ll never pay us and that I should drop the issue at this point. He says that since she\u2019s a single mom it\u2019s probably hard on her and we should cut them both some slack.

My high school sweetheart (J) died at 24. Before he died he had proposed, I said yes. I was so struck with grief that I could never bring myself to take off the ring he gave me. Around 2 years ago I finally moved on and chose to adopt a girl, (L). Everyone at the firm assumes I\u2019m married due to the ring and kid. One of my co-workers (C) apparently had a crush on me. I invited a group of friends from work over for my birthday and they all asked about my husband. I told them how he had passed and it was just me and my daughter. They were all a bit shocked but didn\u2019t say more, except for C. He lost it and said \u201cSo you\u2019ve just been lying to us?? For all these years?

by my dad. I'm 15f.\n\nDad started dating Jane a while ago,  maybe a year. She has a daughter Mandy that's 12 or 13 I think. Then they started spending A LOT of time by my dad's.  They have their own apartment but they're still always by him. \n\nThe first time they stayed over when I was there somehow Mandy ended up in my bed. Her mom has this cot/bed thing she brought by my dads for her but somehow I woke up in the middle of the night and she was in my bed. I kicked her out.  Then my dad and Jane said \"that was mean and I have a full anyway so I should share\". \n\n There's other stuff,  I have a chair in my dad's living room I got for my a gift.  It's comfy and when I move out it'll go with me.  Well Mandy always wants to race for the chair,  even when I win the \"race\" my dad makes me let her sit in it because they're guests.  So I end up sitting on the floor because my dad has a recliner and Jane lays across the couch. So I stay in my room instead, my dad's tried getting me to come out there by them, but why when I have to sit on the floor like a dog?  He keeps saying \"I'm being a difficult teenager \" that's not it though.  \n\nOne time my mom and I went and did some stuff before she dropped me off. She had bought me a blanket that had my favorite teams logo on it. I was excited to sleep with it (stupid I know) so she let me take it by my dads.  My dad made me \"share\" it with Mandy, because it wasn't fair that I got something and Mandy didn't.  \n\nIt's not just the blanket it's happened with it's anything that I have I have to share, but if Mandy has something I'd like to use he tells me it's hers and if she doesn't want to let me she doesn't have to. \n\nOne time mandy was reading one of my books, and Jane and my dad started fighting, Jane wanted to leave so Mandy wanted to take my book but I said no. So she wouldn't leave. My dad yelled at me to \"just let her have it\". They made up so I got it back, but if they didn't I would have lost one of my favorite books. \n\nMy dad and I had plans to go ice fishing,  just him and I something we've done since I was 7. Well he brought Jane and Mandy along. All they did was complain, \"it's to cold\" \"fish are gross\" \"this is boring \". So we left early.  He said \"sometimes you have to compromise\". \n\nWhen I got home I was mad,  my mom was annoyed and  called him and they argued and he talked to me and repeated his compromising crap. \n\n I was supposed to go back by him a few days later but decided I didn't want to, I never even spend time with just him anymore so what's the point in going there. \n\nI told my mom she said it was my choice. So we told him, he said \"I'm just used to being a only child and I can't be spoiled my whole life\". And \"I can't run away whenever there's a problem \".\n\nWell since then, his family is trying to get me to go back too.\n\nAITA for not visiting my dad anymore\n\n\nEdit: Some people have said to go to family counseling.

I&amp;#39;m 15f.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad started dating Jane a while ago,  maybe a year. She has a daughter Mandy that&amp;#39;s 12 or 13 I think. Then they started spending A LOT of time by my dad&amp;#39;s.  They have their own apartment but they&amp;#39;re still always by him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time they stayed over when I was there somehow Mandy ended up in my bed. Her mom has this cot/bed thing she brought by my dads for her but somehow I woke up in the middle of the night and she was in my bed. I kicked her out.  Then my dad and Jane said &amp;quot;that was mean and I have a full anyway so I should share&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s other stuff,  I have a chair in my dad&amp;#39;s living room I got for my a gift.  It&amp;#39;s comfy and when I move out it&amp;#39;ll go with me.  Well Mandy always wants to race for the chair,  even when I win the &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; my dad makes me let her sit in it because they&amp;#39;re guests.  So I end up sitting on the floor because my dad has a recliner and Jane lays across the couch. So I stay in my room instead, my dad&amp;#39;s tried getting me to come out there by them, but why when I have to sit on the floor like a dog?  He keeps saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m being a difficult teenager &amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s not it though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time my mom and I went and did some stuff before she dropped me off. She had bought me a blanket that had my favorite teams logo on it. I was excited to sleep with it (stupid I know) so she let me take it by my dads.  My dad made me &amp;quot;share&amp;quot; it with Mandy, because it wasn&amp;#39;t fair that I got something and Mandy didn&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just the blanket it&amp;#39;s happened with it&amp;#39;s anything that I have I have to share, but if Mandy has something I&amp;#39;d like to use he tells me it&amp;#39;s hers and if she doesn&amp;#39;t want to let me she doesn&amp;#39;t have to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time mandy was reading one of my books, and Jane and my dad started fighting, Jane wanted to leave so Mandy wanted to take my book but I said no. So she wouldn&amp;#39;t leave. My dad yelled at me to &amp;quot;just let her have it&amp;quot;. They made up so I got it back, but if they didn&amp;#39;t I would have lost one of my favorite books. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad and I had plans to go ice fishing,  just him and I something we&amp;#39;ve done since I was 7. Well he brought Jane and Mandy along. All they did was complain, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s to cold&amp;quot; &amp;quot;fish are gross&amp;quot; &amp;quot;this is boring &amp;quot;. So we left early.  He said &amp;quot;sometimes you have to compromise&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home I was mad,  my mom was annoyed and  called him and they argued and he talked to me and repeated his compromising crap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to go back by him a few days later but decided I didn&amp;#39;t want to, I never even spend time with just him anymore so what&amp;#39;s the point in going there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my mom she said it was my choice. So we told him, he said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just used to being a only child and I can&amp;#39;t be spoiled my whole life&amp;quot;. And &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t run away whenever there&amp;#39;s a problem &amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well since then, his family is trying to get me to go back too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA for not visiting my dad anymore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some people have said to go to family counseling.  He won&amp;#39;t do that. He put me in therapy a few years back,  because I wasn&amp;#39;t doing my homework, seriously that&amp;#39;s the reason.  Then when my therapist started calling him out on his parenting he didn&amp;#39;t want to go anymore and my mom had to take me.

Dress shopping has been a bit stressful for her, as all the dresses that fit her taste are just so far out of her budget.

married to Joseph m33 for 2 years, We had a long distance relationship and I moved to his country shortly before marriage.\n\n\nMy family only visted us at the wedding and I haven't seen them eversince, When I got pregnant they wanted to visit, but Joseph didn't allow it saying that meeting \"people\" coming from a distance might harm our then unborn baby, I got to video chat with them but not much.\n\n\nWhen I gave birth to our son nearly 12 months ago, I wanted my family to visited, Joseph said we should wait because having visitors around a newborn, especially from another country might affect our son's health. A week turned into a month, and a month turned into months. It's been nearly 12 months now and my family haven't met my son in person. Last night I brought it up with him and said I want them to visit for our son's 1st birthday party. He said there was no need for a birthday party and suggested that we wait til our son is old enough so he won't pick up on words my family say that might confuse him. I suddenly couldn't take it and blew up.

The father is absent in his life and only pays CS, she has always hated the idea of my nephew growing without a father figure and since our only brother is 17 and our dad passed ten years ago, she dated recklessly for a while and introduced him to a bunch of dudes.\n\nThree years ago I met my now fianc\u00e9, Gabriel (28M), he's really sweet and adores my family, he's financially stable and is good with kids, has a bunch of nephews on his own and comes from a good, big family. We've decided to be child-free and if something happens to my sister and a few of Gabe's siblings, we're meant to be their legal guardians. \n\nFor the past year my sister has grew comfortable with pushing Joe around Gabe, she always invites him to my nephews activities (which is fine, but she acts as if Gabe were her guest and I'm his +1, not otherwise, plus my brother used to be the one who got invited and he's not anymore), she asks Gabe to drive her and Joe to places and my mom pointed out how they look like a family when he does it, she jokes about how much of a dad Gabriel is for Joe and she had the audacity to ask him once if he was comfortable with adopting Joe, but she was drunk so I'll give her that.\n\nNeither Gabe or I are comfortable with this, he doesn't know how to push it aside without hurting their feelings, my mom has told my sister countless time how this is inappropriate but my sister always gets defensive and says that Joe chose him and ''is not her fault''. Things blew up last weekend when Joe asked Gabriel if he could call him dad because ''mom said it was fine'', my sister was looking at them with the biggest smile on her face and I could noticed how my mom and my brother were expecting his answer (neither of them agree with it too). He sat Joe in his knee and kindly explained him how he wasn't his dad or even a dad figure, that he was aunt's OP soon to be husband and that made him his ''favorite'' uncle, but even if he wasn't his dad, he would never leave him and they'll always be best friends. Joe, being the sweet kid he is laughed and smiled and said that it was okay, then he ran tot he living room to play with something. I think the situation resolved itself okay, but my sister didn't liked it and started to fight with us. My mom kept telling her to shut up but she was saying things like ''what's wrong with you two?'', ''how can you say no to a little kid?'', ''he sees you as a father, so you should be proud of that'', I had enough and I told her that Gabriel wasn't Joe's dad and that she needed to stop acting as if he was because it was honestly embarrassing.\n\nShe called me a selfish c\\*nt and said that I was jealous of her kid. I just rolled my eyes and we decided to leave after. She later sent me a text saying that it was best if we step out of Joe's life for a while or we will end up ''confusing'' him because he doesn't understand that Gabriel is not daddy. But as far as I could se he got it pretty well.\n\nETA: I'M SORRY, I didn't mean to say that we're already Joe's legal guardians, but if something happens to my sister (and we hope it never does), we'll be taking care of him.

lot. When I was pregnant, I used to stay with my inlaws whenever he had a trip. His parents are saints, they adore me and always offer to help with everything. They say that I'm like the daughter they never had. \n\nBefore I gave birth Jerry told me he had to go on a business trip and he was most likely going to miss our son's birth because he was going away for 2 weeks. I was upset but he explained that he was doing this to be able to provide for us and our son. I wasn't okay with it but it's ultimately his decision though I'm sure if he had explained to his company they'd have probably given him time off.\n\n\nJerry asked that I go stay with my family instead of hus because, he said that if they found out that he was going on a trip and missing our son's birth they'd give him grief. I agreed but went to stay with my family. turned out that Jerry lied to his parents about being there for our son's birth and asked them to not visir til later because he was allegedly worried for our newborn and wanted me to get rest.\n\n\nLast sunday, His mom and dad finally visited after he returned from his trip and I returned home after staying with my family for a couple of weeks. We were talking about our son and Jerry's mom asked Jerry about our hospital stay, he said that I didn't stop complaining about everything and that I was being \"difficult\" to everyone. I was shocked, his mom laughed and said all women are like that after the give birth but I told her that yes but not all men abandon their wives during one of their most difficult times and miss their first baby's birth over a work trip that could've easily been rescheduled. Jerry's mom asked what I meant amd I told her her son wasn't there for the birtj of his first child. She unleased her anger upon him and his dad joined in. a huge argument ensued and Jerry started lashing out then told me we had to leave.\n\n\nIn the car he went off calling me childish and petty for \"outing\" him to his parents and tattling on him like that. He said that I had no right to even complain because it wasn't like he was on a vacation or golfing trip but was just working hard to be able to provide for us *as the breadwinner* and I should respect that and be thankful instead of stirring shit and trying to gain his parents sympathy while turning them against him. I got home and started crying while arguing with him. he still said I was out of line to do what I did and act like his work isn't as important.\n\nWe stopped talking after that, And from what I understand, his parents are still pretty much upset with him and he's saying I'm the reason why he's being harrassed by them.\n\nI think that I went too far by telling them.

They also use the full sized garage in the back to store things. \n\nFor the last 2 years J and I have lived together semi-peacefully. She's quite messy and due to my mental health (messes causing worse anxiety and depression) I tend to clean up a lot after her. She also has 2 dogs and a cat. She asks me to feed and let out her dogs on a regular basis, her dogs will sometimes get into the garbage or her cat will pee and poop downstairs cause she hates the boys, and J expects the first person to see the mess to clean it up even though it is from her animals. I also have a small room that barely fits my bed while J has a bedroom and a spare room to herself. The boys have a whole basement and the garage to themselves. \n\nNow to the issue that broke the last straw for me.  J gets our hydro/electricity bill every 2 months and for the last billing period she got a HUGE bill. It is winter and we do live in Northern Canada so it can get quite cold. I was also gone on vacation for 3/8 weeks that this bill was covering. J has been complaining about how expensive utilities are and how outrageous this is for her to pay all of this. I pay her rent for March a few days early so she has time to etransfer rent to the actual owner of the house. I sent her an extra $100 cause I felt bad about the utilities and after she received it she texted me and asked for an extra $150. So $250 on top of my normal rent.

She's making me feel like a freeloader that costs her so much money... \n\nMy friend just bought a house and offered to let me move in. So last night I gave J my notice and told her I would be out of the end of March. I am actually moving out next week because I cannot stand to be here any longer.

by saying that I, Male 32, was a drug addict for 6 years. I got clean and am no longer a user, however, I do have scars all over bith of my arms from using and although I tend to cover up due to shame and insecurity, I've finally made peace with my past. I met my now wife and have been clean for 4 years now.\n\n\nHer family are decent folks, except...her dad can be a bit hostile towards me but he always says he's just trying to make sure he's daughter is treated well. We both have this tension between us that never seems to fade.\n\nI recently found out that my wife is pregnant, We were both overjoyed and excited to tell everybody, starting with my inlas. We visit some days ago and broke the news to everyone. My father inlaw started side-eyeing me for a bit and sitting there while everyone was congratulating us. My wife asked her dad if he was okay and he just got up from his seat and walked up to and said that he wanted me to roll my sleeves up so he cpuld take a look at my arms. I looked at him in utter confusion, and he bluntly said \"You gotta a baby on the way, I wanna make sure my daughter is making the right decision and you're not using again\" I got mad and we began exchanging words. I refused to show him my arms and told him off, my mother inlaw asked me to do it because I have nothing to hide, yet I refused because it felt beyond disrespectful.

We had what I believe to be a fairly standard pregnancy and I did my best to take care of things and make it easy for her. I took her to the hospital when she was due and her sister and mother met us there.\n\nThe problem started when she was taken to the delivery room. She asked the nurse that only her mother and sister (F27) be allowed in the delivery and then told me that she wanted me to wait until \"I've delivered and calmed down\" before letting me into the room. I was kind of shocked and didn't want to make a scene so I just said OK and sat down in the waiting room. We had not really discussed the plan for the hospital and I had no reason to think I wouldn't be there when my son was born.\n\nI texted her sister if she knew my wife was going to do this? She said no. I told her to ask if my wife was concerned about something because I don't consider myself someone who would have made a fuss or made things more difficult for her. She texted back after a while saying that my wife \"just doesn't want you to see her like this\" and then added that she didn't agree with my wife and tried to convince her but ultimately it was her choice and I should respect it.\n\nI sat in the waiting room for 6 hours getting minimal updates as the labor was fairly slow, and then I decided that there was no point so I texted her sister that I was going home, I'd meet my son when they brought him home and handle the birth certificate stuff the next day.\n\nThey came home about 9 hours later and I was finally able to meet my son. When my wife's mother and sister left she got very angry at me for leaving her at the hospital. I was angry too but I told her that we can talk about this in a few days because she's just given birth.

We had what I believe to be a fairly standard pregnancy and I did my best to take care of things and make it easy for her. I took her to the hospital when she was due and her sister and mother met us there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem started when she was taken to the delivery room. She asked the nurse that only her mother and sister (F27) be allowed in the delivery and then told me that she wanted me to wait until &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve delivered and calmed down&amp;quot; before letting me into the room. I was kind of shocked and didn&amp;#39;t want to make a scene so I just said OK and sat down in the waiting room. We had not really discussed the plan for the hospital and I had no reason to think I wouldn&amp;#39;t be there when my son was born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted her sister if she knew my wife was going to do this? She said no. I told her to ask if my wife was concerned about something because I don&amp;#39;t consider myself someone who would have made a fuss or made things more difficult for her. She texted back after a while saying that my wife &amp;quot;just doesn&amp;#39;t want you to see her like this&amp;quot; and then added that she didn&amp;#39;t agree with my wife and tried to convince her but ultimately it was her choice and I should respect it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat in the waiting room for 6 hours getting minimal updates as the labor was fairly slow, and then I decided that there was no point so I texted her sister that I was going home, I&amp;#39;d meet my son when they brought him home and handle the birth certificate stuff the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They came home about 9 hours later and I was finally able to meet my son. When my wife&amp;#39;s mother and sister left she got very angry at me for leaving her at the hospital. I was angry too but I told her that we can talk about this in a few days because she&amp;#39;s just given birth. She wouldn&amp;#39;t drop the subject so I finally told her that she excluded me from the birth of my son for no reason, I didn&amp;#39;t see the need to hang around a hospital waiting room for hours doing nothing, and that even her own sister thinks what she did was wrong.

See the bottom for an update. \n\nI'm a high school student in a Spanish class and we had an assignment to make a video tour of a place. It had to be in Spanish, and had to be conversational like you were showing a friend around.\n\nI decided to just walk around my street and make a tour of that because my family wasn't going anywhere else. \n\nSo I filmed:\n\nA neighbors house. When I walked by they were having a screaming fight like usual \"Here are the neighbors, they are very angry. They like to yell in the morning, afternoon, and night.\"\n\nThe next neighbors house \"Joe and Tammy live here, they are very nice and have three dogs\" \n\nSomeone drives by and catcalls me profanely. As a joke I yell back \"ESTUPIDO PERRO\" which means \"stupid dog\" then he  slammed his brakes and yelled something racist before speeding off. I said to the camera \"This man is very stupid. He is a man but acts like a dog.\"\n\n(Edit to clarify something, I'm white but I think this idiot assumed I as Hispanic because I was speaking Spanish. A lot of people in the comments are talking about my experiences as a person of color, and I just wanted to clear up that I'm not, and don't want to speak for the people who actually experience this kind of shit regularly. Because one rude comment is nothing like having those kinds of experiences all your life.) \n\nI also introduced 10 other mundane things like flowers, a bird, etc. \n\nI cut out the long sequences of me walking. But I left everything else. My teacher had a rubric of the types of descriptions and numbers of things you needed and taking any out would lose me points. It was too dark out to film more.\n\nThe second part of the assignment was to upload the video on the school website and post comments back and forth responding to several of your classmates videos. \n\nOne of my friends from class recognized the racist guy as someone who volunteers with the middle school soccer team. So she texted me like \"haha should I say something?\" and I said sure, so she posted in Spanish \"In the car is Mr. Jones who coaches the children. I learned from your video that he hates women and is racist.\" \n \nI replied to say \"Does he teach the girls or the boys\" and she replied back 'Both\". I replied back \"That is terrible.\" \n\nA guy in my class made a comment like \"The man yelling at his family is a police officer. He is always a very angry man.\"  I replied back to say \"That is scary.\"\n\nThe next day at school, my teacher wanted to talk to me alone. She told me that my video was inappropriate and I shouldn't have filmed the neighbors or the coach. I said that the assignment was literally to walk around a place you're familiar with and react, like you're having a conversation with a friend. And that is literally how it goes when I walk around with my friends. \n\nMy teacher said I was being 'beligerent' on purpose and I should have known that stuff has to be dealt with delicately. I said I just don't agree, it's just life and there's no point pretending that's not happening. \n\nShe said she'd taken down the video and it was the sort of thing that should be brought to authorities instead of posted for the whole class. I said I didn't even know who the guy in the car was, and who was I gonna call about the cop? The cops? \n\nI have a meeting with the principal coming up tomorrow. \n\nAITA for having posted that video for the Spanish class?\n\nUpdate;\n\nI had the meeting this morning. I think it went well. I have a study hall now so I have a little time to write an update. \n\nSo, last night I did a bunch of prep. Before the meeting I\n\n- Emailed the video to the elementary school principal, guidance counselor, and a few parents I know with kids on the sports team to say their coach had yelled sexually explicit and hateful things at me, a student in the school system. I wanted to get out ahead and make sure the video was out there before the school might be pressure me to delete it. \n\n- backed up the video to multiple places\n\n- Asked a teacher I trust to sit in on this meeting, and have it be recorded and sent to all participants afterwards. We scheduled it for just before the school day started, on Zoom, so I wouldn't miss any class.\n\n- Decided to write up a list of things I'd want to discuss in the meeting and shared it with my favorite teacher in advance so she could help me address those questions. \n\nAnd for the actual meeting... I decided I'd just go into it, acting as if they would obviously do the right thing. And ask for help. I was hoping having a teacher on my side and the meeting on video would pressure them to help.\n\nI thought if I approached it from an \"well obviously you're going to take this seriously\" perspective and had it on video, it would put them in a tough spot to have to contradict me. \n\nSo when I called in, and everyone said Good Morning and the principal asked if I knew why I had been called in this morning...  I just started out by saying \"Yes, I assume it is about (Kids Coach.) Thank you so much for calling this meeting with me this morning, I really appreciate how proactive you are about addressing the sexual harassment from a staff member... I understand this is a mandated reporting state, I wanted to ask if there was any information you will need to add to your report. \n\nAnd the principal seemed kinda caught out and said that a report had not yet been filled. I said \"Well, as I understand it, there is a 48 hour timeframe to file a report... I understand making you aware of this right before the weekend might have complicated things... Perhaps there was a miscommunication about the severity of the events? But I was approached in a car, sexually harassed and threatened by a man who works with other minors in the public school system.\n\nAs soon as I said all that, the meeting tone really changed. The meeting also had a school guidance counselor on it, and I could tell she understood how serious what I was saying was. Especially because I was politely calling out that they were already past the legal deadline that shey should have filed a report by. She actually took over and the principal didn't participate as much. \n\nI also tried to smooth things over somewhat by saying I was sorry I brought this to their attention in a school project instead of asking for a meeting with the principal directly, I should have reached out for help.\n\nSo that's over. I'm still kinda freaking out how big of a deal it turned out to be. Also I wanted to say thanks to everyone who had great suggestions for how to approach this, like having an adult to back me up, getting the meeting on record, and knowing about mandatory reporting.", "author_fullname": "t2_k5dqd8tt", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 3, "clicked": false, "title": "AITA for turning in a school project that showed my neighborhood and neighbors in a bad light?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AmItheAsshole", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "not", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_t2wmfn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11003, "total_awards_received": 46, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": "", "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Not the A-hole", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11003, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1646085387.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 15, "gid_2": 3}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1645992547.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.AmItheAsshole", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit -I had the meeting with my principal.

The issue ended up being that her boyfriend is our team scribe because he's the only one with neat handwriting.  So after being outvoted a few times on her answers she starts with the, \"Write my answer down or you know what you're not getting when we get home.\"   Well.... no prize for guessing what he does and we end up going from getting almost every question right to getting almost everything wrong.\n\nBefore the final round there is a bonus question.  You get to gamble as many of your points as you want on the bonus question.  Now, we're really far behind so we choose to gamble all of our points.  \n\nWe all agree on the answer except for her.  Hers is written down.  It's wrong.\n\nOne of the interesting things at this trivia is that there's a mystery prize for any team that manages to get a first.  Previous firsts are written on a board.  A final score of 1 is one of the firsts.  I point out that if we purposefully get 0 as our overall score for the night we'll get a First and get the mystery prize.  Everyone on the team starts laughing and agrees we should do it... except her.  She wants us to try our best for some reason. \n\nSo they come around and hand out the cards for the final round and I jump up and take it.  I ask and everyone except him and her agrees that I can be the scribe.  She announces that she won't be part of something lame and walks off.  We end up getting 0 for the round because we don't write anything.\n\nThe overall scores are read out and she returns.  The host announces that we have achieved the First of a 0 score overall and brings over the mystery box.   It's chocolate.  \n\nShe says she's claiming it so I jump in first and grab it and say it's a team prize so we need to decide how to split it.  She is staring daggers at me.\n\nI ask everyone multiple times if they want a share.  They all say no, including her boyfriend.  \n\nI then say, \"I love this chocolate so I'm keeping it.\"  She goes bug eyed and demands her share.\n\nIn a calm voice I tell her that she's been rude to us all night, refused to take part in getting 0 and so she doesn't deserve it.  \n\nEveryone else doesn't want to get involved and leaves.\n\nHe's now blocked all of us on everything and the team are now saying I went too far, I should have understood that she's his girlfriend and should have just shared it with her.  Everyone but one voted to kick me out of the team so now we've formed a breakaway team.

A drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. My car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. I also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). I'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but I'm learning to deal with them. I got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money I purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one I lost. When I have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. I still limp but some days I don't have as pronounced a limp.\n\nEarlier today I went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. I drove. I had to learn to drive with my left foot but I'm really good at it now. I also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my PTSD but I'm doing well there now as well. So, I drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg I also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) I have a handicap placard for my car. I have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. Today I did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. Apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one I took and went down and around. He was still on the other aisle when I pulled in so I didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n\nHe parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how I'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. He then ordered me to move. My group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. I'm sick of people thinking that just because I'm young that I don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. I said \"Okay\", and went to the car and got in like I was going to drive off. I was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when I sat down I took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. I then asked him if it was okay if I still parked there. He walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said I could have just told him and I made him look stupid.\n\nMy group was embarrassed and said that I made things awkward because there was a crowd. AITA?\n\nEdit: in case anyone was interested: I'm not going to post a photo of my leg because of identification reasons but I'll describe it. So the base color is ombre whiteish green to pale green and it has cherry blossoms painted on it, though sometimes I wear a silicone cover that resembles an actual foot and leg on days when I don't want people to stare at me. I even have temporary stickies I can put on the \"toes\" to make it look like I painted my nails.

June. I am very excited to be a grandmother. My daughter is very, very excited and can not wait to be a mother. She already has the nursery all picked out, started buying clothes, getting toiletries such as nappies and wipes organised, the works. We have a very close relationship, and she texts me about her first kicks, baby's heart beat (she has this thing called a doppler?), potential names etc. I am thrilled she is so excited and happy, because in all honesty it was the very opposite of how I felt.\n\nThe truth is I hated being pregnant, with both my children. Pregnancy honestly scared me. I was anxious all the time, every movement and lack of made me scared, I hated the feeling of being so heavy and limited in movement, on top of all the normal pregnancy symptoms of fatigue, nausea, swollen ankles, hemorrhoids, sore back and feet etc. And then don't get me started on the childbirth which was next level. Don't get me wrong, I was very excited to become a mum and I love both my children, they are my absolute world. I just didn't like the process to get there.\n\nOne thing she bought was one of those baby memory books, and has already started by putting some photos of her bump and ultrasound photos in them. For fun, she dug out the baby books I had for both her and younger brother, and we looked through them for a trip down memory lane. For both books, I started at the newborn stage. The pages for \"20 week bump\" and \"First ultrasound\" etc are blank for both. My daughter asked why this was the case. She always thought maybe it was the lack of technology of the time (for you youngin's out there, yes we did have cameras and ultrasounds in the 90s). \n\nThis is when I told her the truth: that I hated being pregnant, it made me scared and anxious, and I didn't want any memories of it. Pregnancy and childbirth terrified me, even for her younger brother when I had a bit more of an idea. I also explained why I was so happy to see her so happy, because I didn't want her to feel like I did.\n\nShe got very quiet and didn't seem very engaged the rest of the time looking at the books. When she left to go home she seemed a bit distant. Later that night my son-in-law called me to say my daughter was very upset about what I said. Apparently I made her feel unwanted, like she was a burden to bear. I was shocked and upset to hear that myself, because that was the opposite of how I felt and told my SIL that. I explained I love my daughter (and her brother) very much and I wouldn't trade them for the world. I just didn't like being pregnant, but that doesn't mean my child was not wanted. My SIL understood, but still said my daughter is upset. \n\nAITA for confessing my feelings? I feel very guilty and the last thing I wanted to do was stress my pregnant daughter out, a time when stress and feeling upset needs to be kept to a minimum.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone who shared their experiences and stories. The support has honestly been overwhelming, I have even teared up at times. I didn't have all this \"back in my day\", and I am so grateful and happy for all women out there present and future that they have all these resources to share their experiences, both positive and negative. \n\nI just want to say this, and what I wish I could say, and what others could freely express, nearly 30 years ago when I was pregnant with my first: Ladies, you are your biggest advocate. If you are having a wonderful time with your pregnancy, like my daughter is, you should be super proud of that and continue to experience the happiness. After all, it leads to one of your biggest joys in life! But for any women out there struggling: that is ok too. Pregnancy is tough. It is hard. It is ok not to like or enjoy it. But we are tough. If you have any concerns or are struggling, speak up. As you can see here, you are not alone.\n\nI will be talking to my daughter this weekend, after giving her some time to cool off. My biggest guilt stems from her feeling unwanted and like a burden. I will sit down with her, as a mother talking to her adult daughter, and explain myself and clarify my position. I'll echo what many are saying here as I share the same sentiment: just because I didn't love pregnancy itself, doesn't mean I didn't love being pregnant with her. And I am genuinely happy for her that she is loving her pregnancy and embracing every moment. It means she isn't feeling what I felt, which wasn't very pleasant. I want to encourage that feeling, but also assure her if she does have any issues they are perfectly valid. \n\nThank you every one once again!", "author_fullname": "t2_k9ue6uxl", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "AITA the telling my daughter the truth of how I felt about being pregnant, and why I have no photos of me pregnant with her?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AmItheAsshole", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "not", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_t5fpg6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10129, "total_awards_received": 14, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Not the A-hole", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10129, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1646349667.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 4}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646271029.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.AmItheAsshole", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My (52F) daughter (28F) is expecting her first child with her husband in June.

I feel very guilty and the last thing I wanted to do was stress my pregnant daughter out, a time when stress and feeling upset needs to be kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you everyone who shared their experiences and stories. The support has honestly been overwhelming, I have even teared up at times. I didn&amp;#39;t have all this &amp;quot;back in my day&amp;quot;, and I am so grateful and happy for all women out there present and future that they have all these resources to share their experiences, both positive and negative. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to say this, and what I wish I could say, and what others could freely express, nearly 30 years ago when I was pregnant with my first: Ladies, you are your biggest advocate. If you are having a wonderful time with your pregnancy, like my daughter is, you should be super proud of that and continue to experience the happiness. After all, it leads to one of your biggest joys in life! But for any women out there struggling: that is ok too. Pregnancy is tough. It is hard. It is ok not to like or enjoy it. But we are tough. If you have any concerns or are struggling, speak up. As you can see here, you are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be talking to my daughter this weekend, after giving her some time to cool off. My biggest guilt stems from her feeling unwanted and like a burden. I will sit down with her, as a mother talking to her adult daughter, and explain myself and clarify my position. I&amp;#39;ll echo what many are saying here as I share the same sentiment: just because I didn&amp;#39;t love pregnancy itself, doesn&amp;#39;t mean I didn&amp;#39;t love being pregnant with her. And I am genuinely happy for her that she is loving her pregnancy and embracing every moment. It means she isn&amp;#39;t feeling what I felt, which wasn&amp;#39;t very pleasant. I want to encourage that feeling, but also assure her if she does have any issues they are perfectly valid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you every one once again!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 100, "id": "gid_1", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.", "end_date": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 4, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Silver", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png"}, {"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

The section I was responsible for seats 52 people (8 tables total). While also handling the bar (seats 20) and to go orders (typically 1 order every 5-10 minutes) outside of our assigned 40+ customers each to care for, as you can expect things fell behind. I had a group of younger friends come in together that asked if they could sit at a different table. I kindly explained to them I\u2019d be happy to move them, however with people still waiting to order food and needing drinks it would be about 20 minutes before I could bus and sanitize the table to swap them. Five minutes later they switched to the dirty table anyways. I was unaware until another table of mine that had stayed behind to chat, handed me $20 saying \u201cI overheard your conversation with the other customers, they have moved and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll tip.\u201d I thanked the man and quickly resumed my tasks.

When she paid her tab she rounded up to the next dollar leaving me with a $0.48 tip on a $140+ bill. I returned her change, looked her in the eyes and said, \u201cClearly you need this more than I do, I hope life gets better for you.\u201d She screamed at me again calling me a bitch, and yelling to fellow patrons at the bar seats stating she will never return because of me. After the adrenaline wore down I began to feel as if my emotions got the best of me and I probably could\u2019ve handled the situation better. She never called the restaurant to complain or anything, but I did tell the manager and my boss (who is also the owner) about the situation. They just laughed and I have faced no repercussions.

I returned her change, looked her in the eyes and said, \u201cClearly you need this more than I do, I hope life gets better for you.\u201d She screamed at me again calling me a bitch, and yelling to fellow patrons at the bar seats stating she will never return because of me. After the adrenaline wore down I began to feel as if my emotions got the best of me and I probably could\u2019ve handled the situation better. She never called the restaurant to complain or anything, but I did tell the manager and my boss (who is also the owner) about the situation. They just laughed and I have faced no repercussions. Outsider POV and advice is very appreciated.

I switched to my mother tongue and told him that if he&amp;#39;s going to talk trash about someone like that then he should at least make sure that he doesn&amp;#39;t speak your language. The guy was caught off guard and embarassed and tried to apologize, but I figured he only apologized because he got caught. Afterwards I told him to get lost and refused to help him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that I felt like I put him in his place, but doubt has been creeping up on me. Should I just have told him off and helped him anyway? I&amp;#39;m not sure what the mature response was supposed to be. Did I overreact?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false,

make jewelry ever since she was a teenager. It wasn\u2019t her job but a hobby and she honestly made some pretty neat stuff. After she passed, Jaime took the things and even wears the jewelry.

We have the same degree/went to the same school together which is how we met and that\u2019s why we lived together for some time.

What you need to know for this is that both my dad and grandpa had kids young, so I'm 15, my dad is 37, and I think grandpa is somewhere in his late 50s. Grandparents divorced when I was a kid and two years later grandpa remarried. His new wife, who's younger than my dad, brought a kid to the marriage, and suddenly I had a step-uncle. Let's just call him Brian.\n\nWhen we first met, the kid was like 4 or something. I thought it would be funny to call him Uncle Brian cause of the ridiculousness of having an uncle so much younger than me. It was a joke and he liked it, so I kept calling him that.\n\nCouple years later and we find out he's not my step-uncle but my half-uncle. Grandpa apparently had a 2nd family he managed to hide even through the divorce and tried to pass his new wife off as someone he'd met just after separating.\n\nCue big drama messy fighting.\n\nI didn't see grandpa and his new family for more than a year. He's only just started patching things up between the rest of our family so I only just met my Brian again. He's become a little shit. He's needy, whiny, and throws tantrums all the time. I just try to ignore him but his mom spoils him so I don't think he'll get better anytime soon.\n\nNone of this would be a problem except when my grandpa was trying to patch things up, he moved closer my family and now Brian and I go to the same school. It's a K-12, and though I don't see him during the day, we sometimes run into each other after school. I've got a club and he's in the after school childcare thing.\n\nWhen we see each other he keeps wanting me to call him Uncle Brian and I keep telling him no. The other day he threw one of his tantrums at school saying I have to call him Uncle Brian. He's my uncle and that means I have to do what he says. I told him no I didn't and that I'm tired of him being a whiny brat. I'm older than him and that means he has to do what I say. He didn't listen and kept saying I have to call him uncle.\n\nWe ended up making a bit of a scene and word got back to our families and Brian's mom said if it meant so much to him that I should just call him uncle. I said I'm not doing that. Grandpa sided with her and my dad hasn't said anything directly but I think he wants me to do it just to keep the peace.\n\nBut it's stupid. He's a kid and calling him Uncle Brian just because he's whining that I have to do it is demeaning, especially at school. It was a joke when he was younger.

But she laughed after saying that and said she was kidding. She had made similar kind of jokes regarding me having a girl child first as well.\n\nWell fast forward to last night. She had come for a visit and brought food with her. She had made my husband's favourite dish and one other dish. She said she had brought the favourite dish only for my husband and the other dish was for me. Well we started eating and I tasted something bitter in my food. It wasn't that much so I just kept on swallowing it with water because I was afraid if I'll complain my MIL will get angry. As I dug deeper with my fork deeper into the food I saw something like black powder. It looked like the food was stuffed with it. I inquired about the same so she told me it was a new spice she got from a friend. I took a mouthful of that stuff and couldn't swallow it at all. I rushed to the bathroom and threw it all up. I got violently sick and my whole mouth became bitter. \n\nWhen I came out my husband gave me some water. Suddenly my MIL got very angry at me and said I was intentionally doing this whole act of throwing up to show she is a bad cook. My husband tried to calm her down but she left our whole but took the food she brought with her while leaving saying we don't deserve it. She even emptied the plate I was eating from in a container and took it as well. \n\nWhile my husband is on my side, others from his family has been very angry at us as well and asking me to apologise.\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: As some of the comments are curious, I will ask the name of spice. I will call my SIL tomorrow. Although I don't think she was trying to intentionally poison me I am now really scared after reading the comments that said that's what she did. I'll update you guys soon.\n\nUpdate: So my SIL just called me who got the whole story out of my FIL. My MIL got the spice from her friend like she said. It was called calnji? Kalnji? Something like that I'll Google it later but just wanted to update you all first. She was cooking that dish for their lunch and didn't know how much she was supposed to add and accidentally put too much. She tasted it and couldn't eat it. Instead of acting like a sane person and throwing it she thought that as she was going to visit us anyways so why not give it to me instead. Her reason was that as I am a horrible cook so I already have a habit of eating bad food ?!? She intentionally made a small portion of my husband's food so I will not take it. I am so so angry at her now and have told my husband she is not allowed in our house anymore. He still think he would like to discuss it with her I am just done with her bs. \nThankyou all for your concern and while I am glad she was not poisoning me I am still shocked by her insensitivity.\n\nUpdate 2: I went to the doctor first thing in the morning and I am completely fine.
