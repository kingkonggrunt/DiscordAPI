Not sure how to cope with the situation or it ending. \n\nSo this is going to be a long one. I know I made a lot of dumb decisions in this situation, so please don\u2019t judge. \n\nI just graduated nursing school, moved out on my own &amp; I am now working as a nurse in the ICU. I am not used to living alone or being out of school so I\u2019ve had a lot of stress/anxiety from that as well as adapting to working in the ICU. After my first night at my new apartment, I woke up to get ready for work around 5am. Just my normal routine. Around 6:40, someone knocked on my door and when I opened it, there was a cute guy standing there. I was extremely confused and he asked me if I \u201cknew what time it was\u201d and why I was being so loud. This really baffled me as I was not being loud. After an awkward interaction, I ended up closing the door and crying because the whole thing just really stressed me out. It was also a bit scary to have some guy knock on your door at 6 am, being a single girl living alone. I told my parents &amp; my dad ended up calling the apartments to complain. Edit to say I asked my dad to call because I was at work and not able to step away. He already knows and has talked with the apartment manager many times. Long story short, my downstairs neighbor, we\u2019ll call him Adam, wrote me a long apology note and put his number on the end of it. My parents both said not to text him but I wanted to because that way he could tell me if I was being loud instead of having to come to my door again.\n\nYeah, you guessed it, I texted him. We got along pretty well &amp; decided to hang in person. He came up to my apartment and we chilled in my bed (bad idea obviously) and talked for a while. I ended up liking him quite a bit as he clearly had some anxiety and depression just like me so I could relate to that. Some of the things he said felt like he pulled them straight from my head. He asked to kiss me &amp; we ended up almost having sex. I know this was terrible as we had just met. After this, we cuddled for a while and talked and he told me how happy he was that he came to my door and met me and that he does like me. The next day he comes over again and acts completely different - doesn\u2019t touch me at all, hug me or anything. After he leaves I text him to ask why he was acting like that and he tells me that he has commitment issues (who is committing here?) and every time he shows emotion to people he backs away. This was an instant red flag and I ended up cutting contact after that because I am healed and ready for an actual relationship. \n\nThis is where things get embarrassing. I\u2019ve been single for around 5 years and I\u2019ve been focused on school.  I haven\u2019t had sex for 5 years either and the only people I\u2019ve had sex with are my two ex boyfriends. After almost having sex, I really wanted to do it. He already told me he can\u2019t like me like that so I try to do fwb with him and see how that works. He comes over again and we actually have sex. It wasn\u2019t great because he was very stressed about it and he didn\u2019t want to get me pregnant (I\u2019m not on birth control). That whole night we talked also and I just found myself liking him more. After this, I knew I could not do friends with benefits with him because I actually am catching feelings. I text him &amp; tell him I want to talk in person again about everything that way I can explain to him why this won\u2019t work. He says okay. He then waits 5 days to text me and when he does he says he \u201ccan\u2019t do anything physical with anyone right now but he wants to be friends\u201d. I ignored this message because he waited way too long to text me after having sex with me and it really made me feel like shit. \n\nFast forward to a week later, I finally text him and tell him I have no hard feelings and that I respect his decision. He says he\u2019s glad I don\u2019t hate him and asks how I\u2019m feeling. I told him I have a lot to say but it\u2019s really not worth me saying at this point. He says he wants to hear it and he\u2019ll come over so we can talk. He comes over but this time we stay in my living room in separate chairs so I can make sure we don\u2019t have sex. I tell him how I feel and he says that he does want a relationship but he\u2019s just not sure how because of how long it\u2019s been. He felt really bad about having sex with me &amp; it shouldn\u2019t have happened because we aren\u2019t dating. He said he wants to hang out with me and go do stuff together and get to know each other so we can maybe eventually get into a relationship. I agree with this and we decide to start over. Well, he asks me to come down to his apartment the next day and things are going great. We are having fun &amp; talking, etc. He even jokes about us moving to Arizona together. He then kisses me and says he wants to have sex. I told him no because we literally just said yesterday we wouldn\u2019t and he is also extremely worried about me getting pregnant? He continues to beg me to have sex and I resist because I feel like he\u2019ll start to ignore me again afterward like he did before. He told me to give him a chance to prove to me that he won\u2019t do that. We end up having sex &amp; cuddling, etc just like before. \n\nThe next day he does text me and acts normally and he even wants me to come over again that night. So I do. When I get into his apartment I can immediately tell that his vibe is off. He\u2019s acting different again just like he did before. I was supposed to pierce his ears for him &amp; we were going to go together to buy some earrings but he also tells me that he\u2019ll be going alone now. We still get along and hang out, but before I leave I decide to bring something up to see where things were at. So, he has told his parents all about me and they even know we have had sex. I haven\u2019t told my parents anything but I said I would tell them and he wanted me to make sure that my parents don\u2019t hate him when I tell them. I ask him before I leave if I should actually tell my mom about him because I don\u2019t want to if he\u2019s going to flake out on me again. And this starts it. He tells me that he doesn\u2019t want anything serious/to be tied down because he can\u2019t make decisions and he\u2019s scared he\u2019ll end up changing his mind. Now I\u2019m heated because literally 2 days ago he was willing to try. I told him that\u2019s a waste of time for me because I want something serious and I\u2019m not going to flake out. He said he respects that and we don\u2019t have to talk anymore. I could feel the tears starting to come &amp; I knew I had to get out of there as soon as possible so I get up to leave and he tried to be nice and make jokes and then he says \u201csee ya\u201d and I look at him and say nothing because if I do I know I\u2019ll start crying. \n\nI get upstairs and start sobbing. It feels like I\u2019ve just been on a rollercoaster of emotions from one day to the next. I text him and say that I find it funny that he says all that stuff &amp; then has sex with me and once again changes his mind. I told him to please never talk to me again because I actually am really hurt this time. He ignores both of my messages. I have never felt so disgusted with myself and used/manipulated. I really did like him. And I\u2019m just so upset now, I was already under a lot of stress with my new job and now I just feel hopeless. Like part of me is just tired of being alive. Not just because of him, but just because of all the bullshit I deal with everyday. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to cope with this because he still lives right below me, I know his car, etc &amp; I feel like I\u2019m just going to be really sad no matter what being here.

I know I made a lot of dumb decisions in this situation, so please don\u2019t judge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just graduated nursing school, moved out on my own &amp;amp; I am now working as a nurse in the ICU. I am not used to living alone or being out of school so I\u2019ve had a lot of stress/anxiety from that as well as adapting to working in the ICU. After my first night at my new apartment, I woke up to get ready for work around 5am. Just my normal routine. Around 6:40, someone knocked on my door and when I opened it, there was a cute guy standing there. I was extremely confused and he asked me if I \u201cknew what time it was\u201d and why I was being so loud. This really baffled me as I was not being loud. After an awkward interaction, I ended up closing the door and crying because the whole thing just really stressed me out. It was also a bit scary to have some guy knock on your door at 6 am, being a single girl living alone. I told my parents &amp;amp; my dad ended up calling the apartments to complain. Edit to say I asked my dad to call because I was at work and not able to step away. He already knows and has talked with the apartment manager many times. Long story short, my downstairs neighbor, we\u2019ll call him Adam, wrote me a long apology note and put his number on the end of it. My parents both said not to text him but I wanted to because that way he could tell me if I was being loud instead of having to come to my door again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you guessed it, I texted him.

I am looking for some outside perspective here, because I don't want to overlook anything and keep an open mind.\n\nFor context: I (26f) got together with my boyfriend (28m) about 1,5 years ago after being friends for a few years. When the second wave of the pandemic hit, we were prohibited from leaving our houses after 9pm, which made our platonic dinners turn into not-so-platonic sleepovers. We told our very tight knit group of friends about stuff happening pretty soon and made it official after only a month of hooking up.\n\nI was drunk on love. He is honestly the funniest, smartest and kindest man I have ever known. We had always had great conversations, but once we got together they just got so much deeper, like we'd spend an entire weekend together and he'd still text me an hour after leaving his place, because he remembered something he wanted to tell me.\n\nIt's the best relationship I ever had. We moved in together and he is my favorite person to live with by far (I have lived with an ex and several of my best friends). We make it a point to always respect each other's needs and love to spend quality time together at home or going out, while still maintaining some healthy me-time.\n\nCommunication has been good. He was not used to expressing his feelings and needs openly, but has made it a point to learn and is doing so good! I wasn't used to letting a partner take care of me sometimes, as I had always been the 'caregiver' in past relationships. We both had some baggage, which I think is normal for our age, but are both determined to learn and grow together.\n\nThe biggest issue we have has been something we started to notice last summer: I am insanely attracted to him. Not just his body and face, but mostly his laugh, his mind, his mischievious smile when he makes a joke... Everything about him just makes me want to be close to him. I have never been a PDA person in the past, but with him I just can't help myself to sneak a kiss or a hug, even when we're with friends.\n\nFrom the beginning it was clear that our sexual needs are different. I have a decently high libido and would like sex every day or every other day if I could. His libido is very much dependant on outside factors. When there is no stress, like on vacation, his needs are pretty similar to mine. If there is a lot of stuff going on in our lives it's hard for him to relax enough to get intimate. We found ways to deal with those differences, whether it's extra care to help him relax or just some intense cuddling to satisfy my need for intimacy. So that is something we're both okay with now, after working it out together.\n\nI don't mind being the one who initiates sex more often, since I am aware of our differences. But there is a lack of enthusiasm in his behaviour, that I can't get quite over. For example he never used to compliment me, whereas I tell him nice things several times a day. I have expressed this and he is really trying hard. It just wasn't something he had ever done, no one had ever asked him to and he didn't intiate it. \n\nHe will now sometimes tell me when he likes an outfit on me or say my perfume smells good or something. The thing is he will always use words like 'nice' or 'cute'. I know this might seem like a small difference, but I want my partner to see me as beautiful and freaking hot. Like I tell him he is. I know it's not fair to expect something so specific from him, but I can't help it. Combined with his lack of initiating sex it makes me feel an insecurity I never knew.\n\nObviously I don't think I am perfect (there is no such thing, it's all subjective anyways) and have small insecurities about my looks, same as everyone else. But I have never doubted how attracted a partner is to me until now. It's so ironic, I dated my fair share of jerks but they were all good at letting me know how attracted they were to me. I always thought: 'Hey, I might not be perfect, but they want me exactly how I am.' Please don't get me wrong, I am not trying to compare my boyfriend to those people. I'm just explaining why this feeling is so new and unsusual to me.\n\nMy boyfriend says he is just not comfortable using words like 'beautiful', because it makes him feel silly. Like it's over the top and doesn't feel natural to him. I try to be respectful of that, but it's hard. \n\nThere has never once been an instance where he just 'had to' touch me or be with me, because he couldn't help himself. So it's not just a matter of words but also actions. I have let him know repeatedly that I would pretty much consent to anything with him, because that's how much I trust him and want him. And if I didn't like anything in the moment, I could always just tell him. So it's not an issue of him being unsure of boundaries (at least not consciously).\n\nHe just isn't that in touch with his sexuality, like doesn't know what his fantasies are etc. He has made so much progress with talking about stuff but somehow this doesn't seem to change.\n\nWow, this is way too long, I'm gonna stop now. If you're still with me: Sorry! Any advice on how to handle a situation like that or make progress is welcome.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend enjoys when I make a move on him and sometimes stuff just happens when we're cuddling or whatever, but I never get the feeling that he has the same intense passion I have for him. We have talked about stuff, but it doesn't really seem to change.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "author_fullname": "t2_huo0suvj", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I don't know if my boyfriend (28m) is as attracted to me as I am to him", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "new", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_t534ev", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 201, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": "", "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "[new]", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 201, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1646236850.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646236432.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 3, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.relationships", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please let me say one thing first: This is an issue that me and my boyfriend have been talking about for a while now, so please don&amp;#39;t immediately assume it stems from a lack of communication.

He has 2 cats he raised from kittens, and a chihuahua he rescued 5 yrs or so before we began dating. I am a dog person. So initially thought his dog was little and cute, and was cautious around his cats, as I wouldn't consider myself a cat lover. With time, I quickly began to love his cats far more than his chihuahua. The dog had behavioral issues. He's jittery and anxious, he'd lunge at you if you said the word \"goodbye\", he'd growl when he got picked up (even by my boyfriend), barks at every sound, growls at other dogs, etc. My biggest annoyance with this creature is that at bedtime, he'd creep underneath the covers and sleep in between my legs. I absolutely hated this and would get woken up 2-3 times every night, to move the dog onto my bf's legs, (as he doesn't mind it) only to be snarled at by the dog when he's being picked up. This wakes up my bf, who gets mad at me for moving his dog. I have voiced to my bf innumerous amount of times about my issues with his dog. I've told him how he disrupts my sleep and is not being disciplined properly or even trained at all. But my boyfriend always dismisses me saying \"he's just a scared and cold chihuahua\" and get's upset that I don't want to spend time with his dog. I began to train his dog, teaching him tricks and trying to get him used to be in a crate for bedtime, but my boyfriend has not supported me using the crate or kept up with using a trick system to reward the chi. I have a pom/Weiner dog I raised with my mom, (she lives with her) and she is the sweetest angel. She's smart, obedient, loving to everyone, and my bf also thinks she's great. She uses a doggy bed at night, which has its own heater, and is very luxurious. I bought one for my boyfriend's chi, but it does not get used...\n\nThe situation worsened when I was bitten by his dog. One of my boyfriend's cats had vomited, and the chihuahua was running toward it to eat. I had put my hand out to stop the dog, but he got very possessive and bit my hand. After my hand had healed, my bf would refuse to acknowledge how untrained his dog really is.

He has 2 cats he raised from kittens, and a chihuahua he rescued 5 yrs or so before we began dating. I am a dog person. So initially thought his dog was little and cute, and was cautious around his cats, as I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider myself a cat lover. With time, I quickly began to love his cats far more than his chihuahua. The dog had behavioral issues. He&amp;#39;s jittery and anxious, he&amp;#39;d lunge at you if you said the word &amp;quot;goodbye&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;d growl when he got picked up (even by my boyfriend), barks at every sound, growls at other dogs, etc. My biggest annoyance with this creature is that at bedtime, he&amp;#39;d creep underneath the covers and sleep in between my legs. I absolutely hated this and would get woken up 2-3 times every night, to move the dog onto my bf&amp;#39;s legs, (as he doesn&amp;#39;t mind it) only to be snarled at by the dog when he&amp;#39;s being picked up. This wakes up my bf, who gets mad at me for moving his dog. I have voiced to my bf innumerous amount of times about my issues with his dog. I&amp;#39;ve told him how he disrupts my sleep and is not being disciplined properly or even trained at all. But my boyfriend always dismisses me saying &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s just a scared and cold chihuahua&amp;quot; and get&amp;#39;s upset that I don&amp;#39;t want to spend time with his dog. I began to train his dog, teaching him tricks and trying to get him used to be in a crate for bedtime, but my boyfriend has not supported me using the crate or kept up with using a trick system to reward the chi. I have a pom/Weiner dog I raised with my mom, (she lives with her) and she is the sweetest angel. She&amp;#39;s smart, obedient, loving to everyone, and my bf also thinks she&amp;#39;s great. She uses a doggy bed at night, which has its own heater, and is very luxurious. I bought one for my boyfriend&amp;#39;s chi, but it does not get used...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The situation worsened when I was bitten by his dog. One of my boyfriend&amp;#39;s cats had vomited, and the chihuahua was running toward it to eat. I had put my hand out to stop the dog, but he got very possessive and bit my hand. After my hand had healed, my bf would refuse to acknowledge how untrained his dog really is. This is another reason why I feel we should separate even though my heart doesn&amp;#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent hours looking up possible solutions to this problem, but I&amp;#39;ve only been finding answers that say because his dog is coming between us, we should break up.

We started dating immediately after we met, but it was a very brief relationship (about a month) and we were 16 and 17 at the time. I was the one to break things off, reason being I just didnt have any romantic/sexual attraction to him. We are way better as friends then we ever would have been as a couple. Of course we went on to date other people, but he is my best friend and I never felt there was anything I couldn't tell him even when it came to my relationships.\n\nEventually I started dating my current boyfriend C (27M). As we got to know each other, I told him about my history with G, so he is aware that we dated before but things are 100% platonic now, plus at this time G had a long term girlfriend. C did express to me that he was a bit insecure about my relationship with G since we dated before, but said he was alot more comfortable with him after he'd met him and saw how we interacted. They even became friends and have their own friendship outside of me.\n\nFast forward to the present: C and I have been together for 3.5 years, but the last year has been rocky, and G being my best friend is the one I vent to when I'm not happy or we've had a fight. G is single and has been casually dating for the last year or so, after a very traumatic breakup with his ex girlfriend. Last weekend I hung out with G and he asks how Valentine's Day went, which leads to me expressing some negative thoughts about my relationship. As we're talking, G ends up confessing that he has romantic feelings for me. When I asked how long, he said \" a while\" and that when he's seeing other people he's thinking of me and he feels that's why it hasn't worked out with other women he's dated since his last serious girlfriend. He apologized alot and said he feels guilty telling me this when I have a boyfriend plus the fact that he's friends with my boyfriend. He also said it's perfectly okay if I don't feel the same and that he didn't want this to change our friendship. \n\nI don't feel the same way at all, my \"romantic\" feelings for him haven't changed one bit since high school. I view him as family. I'm very free and open with my affection and emotions towards everyone, so I really feel like he just misses intimacy and that feeling of caring and being cared for after his last relationship and he's mistaking that affection and intimacy we have as best friends for romantic feelings. Looking back, I think he's had feelings for me at least since his break up 2 years ago, probably even longer. Since he's told me this, we haven't talked much and I told him I needed some time away from him. \n\nMy dilemma is that I feel G and I will get past this and can still remain friends, which make me unsure if I should tell C about it or not. If G and I are moving on from this, I don't want to cause drama or ruin their friendship by telling C, because even if G and I are both past it, Im not sure if C will get over it. I don't want to end up in a situation where I'm forced to choose between the two of them. But not telling C makes me feel like I'm lying to him and I don't know if my friendship with G will ever be the same after this anyway even if C were to be 100% okay with everything. \n\nDo you think people can stay friends after someone catches feelings for the other person? Is it worth trying to hold on to the friendship if I feel like I have to be extra conscious of what I say and do around him to not provoke his feelings? Should I or should I not tell my boyfriend? I don't know what to do. I honestly wish he hadn't told me. I can't look at my boyfriend without feeling like a liar for not telling him yet especially knowing he was worries about this in the first place, and I don't think I'll ever be 100% comfortable and open with my best friend again. \n\n\nTL;DR - my best friend confesses he has feelings for me, even though I'm in the relationship and he's friends with my boyfriend. I don't feel the same way at all.

I moved here with my ex Adam (31) around 7 years ago. We broke up 4 years ago and around 2 years ago we were finally able to become friends. I rely on him like family, see him frequently. We\u2019ve a strange and unique relationship but it works with reasonable rules and conditions.\n\nI lived with Adam\u2019s family for about a year when I first moved here, which is where I met his brother Kyle (26). Adam and Kyle have never been friends. They come from a unique broken family and Kyle has his issues, but the problem with their relationship is all Adam\u2019s. Kyle just wants to be loved by the older brother that has rejected him while Adam is embarrassed by Kyle. When I lived with their family Kyle and I did kinda treat each other as the brother each other never had. Despite our small age gap I felt I had wisdom to offer him, I understood him, and I liked him. I didn\u2019t want anything from him, we just got on well together.\n\nAfter my break up with Adam, Kyle also came out as gay and they ended up living together (with the prior knowledge of Adam\u2019s general disdain towards Kyle I was surprised to hear this. I suppose it benefited them both financially).\n\nNot long after I reconnected with Adam the brothers fell out, moved out, and now live separately. As a final act, Adam found Kyle a new apartment literally next door to his new apartment and they haven\u2019t spoken since, approx. 2 years. \n\nOne night about 1.5 years ago, I was drinking with Adam and decided to try and advocate for Kyle with my Dutch courage. It didn\u2019t go well, Adam left and drew his familial relationships as a boundary, and I agreed to respect that boundary.\n\nThe following summer Adam and I had another separate altercation around his family that almost ended out friendship. His cousin is from my home country and we accidentally bumped into each other and we then spent some time together without Adam, which upset him massively. Since then I\u2019ve kept away from anything to do with his family, and he\u2019s kept me at arms length.\n\nBackground out of the way, today I was on my way to Adam\u2019s for coffee and I bump into Kyle. Kyle looks absolutely terrible. Alopecia, loss of weight, his demeanour was despondent and angry.

I moved here with my ex Adam (31) around 7 years ago. We broke up 4 years ago and around 2 years ago we were finally able to become friends. I rely on him like family, see him frequently. We\u2019ve a strange and unique relationship but it works with reasonable rules and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lived with Adam\u2019s family for about a year when I first moved here, which is where I met his brother Kyle (26). Adam and Kyle have never been friends. They come from a unique broken family and Kyle has his issues, but the problem with their relationship is all Adam\u2019s. Kyle just wants to be loved by the older brother that has rejected him while Adam is embarrassed by Kyle. When I lived with their family Kyle and I did kinda treat each other as the brother each other never had. Despite our small age gap I felt I had wisdom to offer him, I understood him, and I liked him. I didn\u2019t want anything from him, we just got on well together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my break up with Adam, Kyle also came out as gay and they ended up living together (with the prior knowledge of Adam\u2019s general disdain towards Kyle I was surprised to hear this. I suppose it benefited them both financially).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not long after I reconnected with Adam the brothers fell out, moved out, and now live separately. As a final act, Adam found Kyle a new apartment literally next door to his new apartment and they haven\u2019t spoken since, approx. 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night about 1.5 years ago, I was drinking with Adam and decided to try and advocate for Kyle with my Dutch courage. It didn\u2019t go well, Adam left and drew his familial relationships as a boundary, and I agreed to respect that boundary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following summer Adam and I had another separate altercation around his family that almost ended out friendship. His cousin is from my home country and we accidentally bumped into each other and we then spent some time together without Adam, which upset him massively. Since then I\u2019ve kept away from anything to do with his family, and he\u2019s kept me at arms length.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background out of the way, today I was on my way to Adam\u2019s for coffee and I bump into Kyle. Kyle looks absolutely terrible. Alopecia, loss of weight, his demeanour was despondent and angry. He and I have always had a decent bond and have dealt with similar circumstances (I\u2019ve even had and overcome stress-related alopecia) and I know a massive part of his problem is loneliness, isolation, and familial rejection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ego out of the way, me reaching out will almost definitely help Kyle somewhat.

I'm honored that he wants me to be one of his groomsmen. That said, the idea of it is getting increasingly difficult. They decided to do a destination wedding on the other side of the country at Disneyland in California. I have nothing against it if that is what makes him and his future wife happy, but I live in Alabama now. That means plane tickets + rental car = $$$. They also have the rehearsal dinner on a Thursday, wedding on Friday, and expect the bridal party to be in town by Wednesday evening. That means most likely three days of vacation from work. He also wants the bridal party to stay in one of Disney's actual hotels = $$$. He started getting pretty miffed when I suggested I didn't want to do that and would prefer to stay at hotel further out from the park to save money. I've never paid this kind of money for a vacation or trip for \\*myself\\* let alone someone else.  \n\n\nI've also been a bit miffed by his attitude regarding it. When he first asked me to be in his wedding, he bragged about how he wasn't going to have to pay a dime for a wedding because the bride's parents were going to pay for it. Great! That means more money to start your life together. Then he went into a speech about how I needed to start taking a little money out of each paycheck to make sure that I could afford being in the wedding. The obvious rudeness of trying to tell someone else how to manage their money unsolicited aside, it seems like you might be taking it a little far if you think it is necessary to tell your groomsmen to make a separate line item in their budget two years out from the wedding to make it all work after you just made it clear that this is all going down at no cost to yourself. But, hey, that is their business and it is what it is.  \n\n\nOther than that, there were also some implications made that it would be preferable that I didn't bring my girlfriend with me. They didn't outright say it, but it came up a few different times to the point that I don't feel like I'm unfairly assuming. \"It'll be more expensive and you'll be spending most of your time doing things for us anyway.\" Oh, uh, alright. Did you know I'll probably be engaged to her by then and probably won't want to leave her behind for a weekend? \"Oh. Are you sure about that? It seems like you are assuming a lot could happen between then and now.\" Well, yes, the wedding isn't happening for two more years - I'd say a lot could happen in that time.  \n\n\nAll this to say, I know the wedding is very important to him. He wouldn't be acting like this if it wasn't and I know the wedding planning is probably bringing out a little bit of groomzilla that doesn't normally define him. And I respect what he wants here - it is his day. But, damn. It doesn't sound fun. It sounds extremely expensive and time consuming. If you were in my shoes, do you think it would be wrong to tell your childhood best friend no to being in his wedding?

I&amp;#39;m honored that he wants me to be one of his groomsmen. That said, the idea of it is getting increasingly difficult. They decided to do a destination wedding on the other side of the country at Disneyland in California. I have nothing against it if that is what makes him and his future wife happy, but I live in Alabama now. That means plane tickets + rental car = $$$. They also have the rehearsal dinner on a Thursday, wedding on Friday, and expect the bridal party to be in town by Wednesday evening. That means most likely three days of vacation from work. He also wants the bridal party to stay in one of Disney&amp;#39;s actual hotels = $$$. He started getting pretty miffed when I suggested I didn&amp;#39;t want to do that and would prefer to stay at hotel further out from the park to save money. I&amp;#39;ve never paid this kind of money for a vacation or trip for *myself* let alone someone else.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been a bit miffed by his attitude regarding it. When he first asked me to be in his wedding, he bragged about how he wasn&amp;#39;t going to have to pay a dime for a wedding because the bride&amp;#39;s parents were going to pay for it. Great! That means more money to start your life together. Then he went into a speech about how I needed to start taking a little money out of each paycheck to make sure that I could afford being in the wedding. The obvious rudeness of trying to tell someone else how to manage their money unsolicited aside, it seems like you might be taking it a little far if you think it is necessary to tell your groomsmen to make a separate line item in their budget two years out from the wedding to make it all work after you just made it clear that this is all going down at no cost to yourself. But, hey, that is their business and it is what it is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, there were also some implications made that it would be preferable that I didn&amp;#39;t bring my girlfriend with me. They didn&amp;#39;t outright say it, but it came up a few different times to the point that I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;m unfairly assuming. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll be more expensive and you&amp;#39;ll be spending most of your time doing things for us anyway.&amp;quot; Oh, uh, alright. Did you know I&amp;#39;ll probably be engaged to her by then and probably won&amp;#39;t want to leave her behind for a weekend? &amp;quot;Oh. Are you sure about that? It seems like you are assuming a lot could happen between then and now.&amp;quot; Well, yes, the wedding isn&amp;#39;t happening for two more years - I&amp;#39;d say a lot could happen in that time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this to say, I know the wedding is very important to him. He wouldn&amp;#39;t be acting like this if it wasn&amp;#39;t and I know the wedding planning is probably bringing out a little bit of groomzilla that doesn&amp;#39;t normally define him. And I respect what he wants here - it is his day. But, damn. It doesn&amp;#39;t sound fun. It sounds extremely expensive and time consuming. If you were in my shoes, do you think it would be wrong to tell your childhood best friend no to being in his wedding? I feel like he is going to take it extremely personally and could jeopardize the friendship, but I don&amp;#39;t feel like he is being all that considerate and I feel like the costs are a bit unreasonable for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TD;LR: Childhood best friend [28/m] wants me [25/m] to spend well over a $1000 dollars and three days of vacation to be part of his destination wedding.
